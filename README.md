# AssignmentOne

Objective:
In this assignment, you will use stacks and queues to process a log file containing 10,000
entries. Each log entry follows a specific format that includes a timestamp, log level, and
message. The goal is to demonstrate your understanding of stack and queue operations by
implementing a series of tasks.

Log Entry Format Example:
[2024-08-23 14:35:21] INFO User123 logged in
[2024-08-23 14:35:22] ERROR Database connection failed
[2024-08-23 14:35:23] WARN Memory usage at 85%

Tasks:
1. Implement Queue Operations:
o Read the log file into your program.
o Enqueue all log entries into a queue.
o Dequeue entries one by one until the queue is empty (do not print them)

3. Implement Stack Operations:
o Implement a stack to handle and store error log entries (log level: ERROR).
o Every time an error log entry is dequeued from the queue, it should be
pushed onto the stack.

5. Data Analysis
o Implement functionality to perform the following analysis on the log data:
1. Count Log Levels: Calculate the total number of entries for each log
level (INFO, WARN, ERROR). Hint: Do the calculations during
dequeue.
2. Recent Errors: Provide a list of the last 100 errors that occurred.
3. Memory Warnings: Track how many times a memory warning (log
level: WARN, containing "Memory") appears.
4. Performance Considerations:
o Your implementation should be efficient in terms of time and space,
especially given the large dataset.
o Consider the use of appropriate data structures and algorithms to handle the
high volume of log entries. Solution hint: Use linked list for the
implementation of both queue and stack.
Submission: All source files should be uploaded to Github. You will submit the link to your
GitHub repository on Canvas. You can work in pairs for this assignment. Team membersâ€™
names and IDs should be included in a README file.
